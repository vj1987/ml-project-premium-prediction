Predictive Health Insurance Model for Shield Insurance 


# Project Overview 
AtliQ AI will develop a predictive model for Shield Insurance to estimate health insurance 
premiums based on factors like age, smoking habits, BMI, and medical history. The project has 
two phases: 
1. Phase 1 (MVP): Build and deploy a predictive model with a Streamlit application. 
2. Phase 2: Develop infrastructure for straight-through processing (STP) of insurance quotes 
(detailed planning and estimation for this phase will be done later). 

Phase 1: MVP Development 

# Objective:
 Develop a high-accuracy (>97%) predictive model. The percentage difference between 
the predicted and actual value on a minimum of 95% of the errors should be less than 
10%. 
 Deploy the model in the cloud so that an insurance underwriter can run it from anywhere.
 Create an interactive Streamlit application that an underwriter can use for predictions. 

# Scope of Work:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
  o Collect and clean labeled datasets. 
  o Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. Model Development
  o Train and evaluate multiple models. 
  o Optimize the best model for accuracy. 

4. Model Deployment
  o Deploy the model on a cloud platform. 
  o Ensure security and scalability. 

5. Streamlit Application Development
  o Build an interactive app for inputting factors and displaying predictions. 

6. Testing and Validation
  o Rigorous testing and validation with real-world data. 

7. Documentation and Training
  o Provide documentation and training for underwriters. 

# Deliverables:
  o Trained model, deployed model, Streamlit app, documentation, and training materials.
